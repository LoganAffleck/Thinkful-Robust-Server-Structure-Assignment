Thinkful Assignment: Robust Server Structure
=============================================
This project required use of Express syntax to create API request controllers. The files I edited are in `src` and were coded to get the tests in `test` to pass. 

Installation
------------
If you would like to install this on your computer and test it out: 
* Click "â†“ Code" and copy the `HTTPS` link ending in `.git`.
* Open Terminal or Windows PowerShell.
* Type and enter`cd ~/Desktop` to set our destination folder as Desktop.
* Type `git clone`, a space, then paste the `HTTPS` link. 
* Hit `Enter/Return` to download the files. 
* Type and enter `cd ./Thinkful-Robust-Server-Structure-Assignment/`
* Type and enter `npm i` This downloads some additional files for the project to work. If this command doesn't work for you, you might need to install Node Package Manager before you continue. You can do that [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* Type and enter `npm run start: dev`. This starts the server. 
* Finally, open a web browser and visit `localhost:5000/urls` to ensure the server is running. 

Sending a Request
-----------------
* If you would like to send a request, download and install [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
* Open Insomnia and click `Create` > and under "New", `Request Collection`.
* Inside the collection, press `ctrl/cmd+N` or `New Request`.
* Give it a name, like "Test Requests", and hit `Create`.
* In the space next to `GET`, type `localhost:5000/urls` and send your request. 
* To change your request, click `GET` and select another type of request. Modify your URL if needed. To see more about the requests that this server supports, check out the instructions I followed below. 



## Assignment Instructions
Your task is to build a URL shortener service API using Node.js and Express. It should allow users to submit a URL and receive a "shortened" code, or ID, that can be used to retrieve the original URL later. It should also keep track of how often each shortened URL is retrieved so you can calculate the most popular URL's.

## What is a URL Shortener?
The e-commerce company that you work for sells many different products under different categories. For example: `www.shoppingsite.com/category/shoe/product/nike132032.`

If a customer wants to share a link to the product on Twitter, they may run into restrictions on the text length.

A URL shortener service overcomes this issue by shortening `www.shoppingsite.com/category/shoe/product/nike/132032` to `www.shoppingsite.com/8d13lk2k.`

## Existing files
You will only need to edit the `src` folder and to follow code organization principles you learned in this module.

Use the existing data files located in `src/data` for the responses. Feel free to add or remove data from the files as necessary, but keep the same shape of the data.

## Tasks
### Create routes and handlers to create, read, update, delete, and list short urls
You will need to create the following API endpoints for the `urls` resources:

HTTP Verb | Path | Description
----------|------|------------
GET | /urls | retrieve a list of all short urls
POST | /urls | create a new short url
GET | /urls/:urlId | retrieve a short url by id
PUT | /urls/:urlId | update a short url by id
GET | /urls/:urlId/uses | retrieve a list of use metrics for a given short url id
GET | /urls/:urlId/uses/:useId | retrieve a use metric by id for a given short url id

Short URLs cannot be deleted once created, because this would break existing links.

*List
*Create

POST `{ data: {"href":"www.some-url.com"} }` to `/urls` should assign an `id` to the object, save it, and return the saved object as a response to the client.

*Read

Additionally, use records are created as a side-effect of a GET request to `/urls/:urlId`. Each use record contains an `id`, a `urlId` which corresponds to id of the URL being tracked by the use metric, and a `time` property (set to `Date.now()`) indicating when the use metric was recorded.

* Update

* List

* Delete

* List Short URL Uses

* Read Short URL Use

* List Short URL uses's in postman

The service should return a `404` error if the `:urlId` and `:useId` are mis-matched. For example, if you send a GET request to `/42/uses/79` and useId `79` is NOT associated with urlId `42` the server should respond with `404`.

## Create routes and handlers to create, read, update, delete, and list use metrics related to short urls
You will need to create the following API endpoints for the uses resources:

HTTP Verb |	Path | Description
----------|------|------------
GET | /uses/:useId | retrieve a use metric by id
DELETE | /uses/:useId | delete a use metric by id
GET | /uses | retrieve a list of all use metrics

The uses resources have a path of `/uses` and are a record of every `GET` request for a specific short url.

* Create
Creating use records through the API is not allowed. Use records are created as a side-effect of a GET request to `/urls/:urlId`.

* Read

* Update

* Delete

* List

## Handle errors properly
* Return a `404` error for any non-existent path or resource
* Methods that are not allowed should return `405` (e.g., a DELETE request sent to `/urls/:urlId`)

## Saving data
There is no database in use for this project. All changes are stored in-memory.

The short url data is exported from `/src/data/urls-data.js`.

The use data is exported from `/src/data/uses-data.js`.

There is some existing data in each file to give you a starting place.

Add and remove data from the arrays using `.push()` and `.splice()` respectively.

When you restart your server, any changes made to these arrays will be lost.

## Assigning IDs
IDs are often assigned by the database. Since your API is not connected to a database, you can use `array.length + 1` to assign ID's, as follows:

```
const newUrlId = urls.length + 1;
const newUseId = uses.length + 1;
```
However, note that this method of assigning ID's to your database records is **NOT** recommended in practice and is only used in this assignment for simplicity so you can focus on building the API. Later on in the backend module, you will learn about industry-standard databases and better ways to assign ID's to database records.

##Assigning time property
Use `Date.now()` to assign the time property of uses.
